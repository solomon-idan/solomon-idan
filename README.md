Hey there! I'm Jacob Solomon Idan, a health enthusiast wearing multiple hats as an Epidemiologist, Biostatistician, and Physician Assistant. I'm all about using data to make healthcare better for everyone.
I've got an MPhil in Field Epidemiology and Applied Biostatistics from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, which basically means I love digging into health data to find meaningful patterns. When I'm not crunching numbers, you can find me helping patients as a Physician Assistant at the University Hospital of the University of Education, Winneba.

Using my mix of medical knowledge and data skills to tackle big health challenges is my passion. I've managed projects on tuberculosis and HIV, mapped healthcare services, and even explored how climate affects road accidents. Recently, I've been diving into infectious disease modeling and it's just fascinating.

I'm a bit of a tech geek when it comes to health data. R, STATA, ArcGIS - these are my playground. I love using these tools to turn complex health information into actionable insights.
When I'm not working, you might catch me reading up on the latest in global health, listening to music, or watching a good movie. I'm always up for a chat about innovative health projects or collaborating on research that can make a real difference in people's lives. Let's connect and explore how we can make the world a healthier place together!
